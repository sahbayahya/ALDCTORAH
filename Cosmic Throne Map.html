      I was watching <em>The Vikings</em>, and the series was causing me multi-dimensional feelings — which means “the people” are engaged. We’re all watching! It spans four seasons, so I probably watched it over the course of three weeks, two to three episodes a day. I would’ve made better time if I wasn’t also deep in other projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a Creative Director, I love watching series and decoding what drives the characters. One of them — the hero of the show — really struck me. He wasn’t chasing the throne for power, but because he knew his people needed a new land, a vision, something beyond what they had. That hit different.

    <h2>The Vikings and the Thrones in the Qur’an</h2>
    <p>
      The Vikings and the Qur'an come from different worlds, but if you listen closely, both hum with echoes of thrones, power, and journeys across realms — earthly and divine.
    </p>
    <h3>The Vikings: Thrones of Blood and Bone</h3>
    <p>
      The Vikings, fierce seafarers from the North, carved their power not just in stone, but in saga. Their idea of a throne was less about gold and velvet, and more about might, honor, and lineage. Kings like Ragnar Lodbrok or Harald Fairhair didn’t rule from heavenly palaces — their thrones were built atop conquest, with Odin watching from Valhalla.
    </p>
    <p>
      They believed in Yggdrasil, the world tree, where the gods ruled from Asgard. Odin, the All-Father, sat on Hliðskjálf, his high seat, from which he could see all nine realms — a divine perch of vision and knowledge.
    </p>
    <h3>The Qur’an: Throne of Light and Majesty</h3>
    <p>
      In the Qur'an, the throne ('Arsh) is on another level — cosmic, metaphysical, limitless in glory. It’s mentioned many times, often paired with God's name Al-‘Arsh al-ʿAẓīm (The Magnificent Throne). It’s not a seat of a mortal king — it’s a symbol of ultimate authority, sovereignty, and order in the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Qur’an flips the throne narrative. While Norse gods ruled from high seats of war and vision, the Qur’an lifts the throne into a realm beyond comprehension — a throne of balance, mercy, and awe.
    </p>
    <h3>The Vibe Shift: Earthly Power vs. Celestial Authority</h3>
    <p>
      Vikings were about epic chaos and conquest, where thrones could be taken by axe. The Qur’an speaks of a throne not to be won, but to be revered. Not conquerable. Eternal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where Norse myths place thrones in the hands of gods who mirror human flaws, the Qur’an places the throne in a divine realm, beyond flaw — where power is purity, and sovereignty is sacred.
    </p>

  <h1>🪐 The Three Thrones of the Cosmos 🪐</h1>
  <p style="text-align:center; max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto;">
    Across sacred verses and stardust echoes, the soul is called to walk three paths. Each throne — al-‘Aẓīm, al-Karīm, al-Majīd — is a gateway to the Divine, a map etched in both myth and mercy.
  </p>

  <div class="throne">
    <h2>🪓 ‘Arsh al-‘Aẓīm – The Magnificent Throne</h2>
    <p>
      This is the Throne of Power and Liberation. The realm of Musa, the sea-splitter, the exile who returned with law and lightning. Those who walk this path are freedom-bearers, justice-forgers. It demands strength, trust, and a heart steady in the face of Pharaohs.

  <div class="throne">
    <h2>💎 ‘Arsh al-Karīm – The Generous Throne</h2>
    <p>
      The throne of provision, healing, and hidden treasures. Like Yusuf, those on this path transmute betrayal into beauty. Generosity flows through wounds made holy. Patience, resilience, and quiet strength are your allies.

    <h2>🌌 ‘Arsh al-Majīd – The Glorious Throne</h2>
    <p>
      This is the throne of light, revelation, and divine intimacy. Walked by Muhammad ﷺ and all mystics, this path unveils the majesty of God in beauty, silence, and presence. You become a mirror of the Real.
