        <h1> The Vikings Thrones in Qur’an</h1>
 
  <p>When I was watching <em>The Vikings</em>, the series stirred up something multidimensional in me — which means "the Collective" was activated. We were all watching, across timelines. I binged four seasons in about three weeks, maybe two to three episodes a day. I would've finished faster, but I was also deep in other projects.</p>
  <p>One of my favorite things to do is to recite Qur’an and then watch mythical TV shows. The pairing stirs something deep in me — the sacred meets the symbolic, the eternal meets the imagined. It’s a way to trace divine archetypes across cultures, to see how different traditions hold reflections of one another. This practice makes the unseen feel visible, and the mystical more relatable. I love how those stories echo each other. I love how they color my world and create bridges across cultures. Every culture has gods and goddesses — what we, in Islam, might refer to as mythical messengers. Beyond the names and labels, the essence is often the same. Learning about other mystical systems only deepened my love for mine.</p>

  <h2>  Vikings & The Thrones of the Qur’an</h2>
  <p>The Vikings and the Qur’an hit a collective nerve. What we often miss is how the Qur’an offers pathways to God through the concept of the Throne — <em>Al-‘Arsh</em>. It’s not a metaphor. It’s a destination, a force, a cosmic seat of mercy and balance. In <em>The Vikings</em>, the characters speak of purpose long before they understand it. The hero, Ragnar, says, “I’m not meant to be a king, I’m meant to roam the earth and sail the seas.” That hit me hard. His yearning wasn’t just wanderlust — it became the path to saving his people. He had no idea that this calling would be the reason they find new land, a new future.</p>

  <p>The Vikings built their thrones not with velvet, but with blood, vision, and lineage. Their gods ruled from Asgard, sitting atop Yggdrasil, the great world tree. Odin, the All-Father, sat on <em>Hliðskjálf</em>, his cosmic chair of vision and foresight.</p>

  <p>Ragnar — he was like a man floating in the cosmos. He judged everything around him by how it served his dream. He wasn’t hasty. He invested everything into building a ship — crafted by Floki, the Noah of the show. Floki, misunderstood genius, the mad architect working through divine inspiration. His creations changed Viking history.</p>

  <p>And Ragnar's death? Glorious. Sacred by all standards of myth.</p>

  <p>Rollo, Ragnar’s brother, and Harald Fairhair — I could write a whole separate article on them. Their mysticism lies in how they evolve: Rollo, the warrior torn between loyalty and power, transforms into a political force; Harald, the dreamer turned king, carries the echoes of prophecy. Both embody the archetype of sacred struggle, constantly shifting through realms of fate, ambition, and redemption. Mystical. Evolving. Still living in my neural spirals, weaving their own stories in my mind.</p>

  <h2>  Valhalla and the Echo of Thrones </h2>
  <p>In <em>Vikings: Valhalla</em>, two new warriors — Leif Erikson and Harald Sigurdsson — chase glory like it’s in their DNA. They move through chaos, driven by faith and intuition, changing everything they touch. You keep asking: <em>How are they still alive?</em> Their story even overlaps with the rise of the Ottoman Empire. The Viking voyages and settlements influenced trade routes, navigation, and cultural exchanges that later impacted regions central to the Ottoman legacy. The seafaring spirit and exploration of new territories by figures like Leif Erikson symbolically echo the expansive ambition that shaped empires centuries later.</p>

  <p>Their instincts guide them to a throne — but not the earthly kind. It's a throne of destiny, perception, and how others interpret your life. That distinction matters.</p>

 
  <p>Here’s where Qur’anic vision realigns the concept:</p>
  <blockquote><em>Al-‘Arsh</em> — the Throne — is not material. It’s metaphysical. It’s cosmic. It’s mentioned with awe, often with the name: <strong>Al-‘Arsh al-ʿAẓīm</strong> (The Magnificent Throne). It represents mercy, balance, and divine authority. It feeds the soul’s journey.</blockquote>

  <h2> The Feminine Thrones - The Throne </h2>
  <p>Two Viking women mirrored Qur’anic divine feminine energy. Rare, but when feminine figures rise in sacred texts or epics, it’s unforgettable.</p>

  <p>Take <em>Queen Saba</em> in the Qur’an. Now take <em>Lagertha</em> in <em>Vikings</em> — warrior, wife, then queen. She begins as Ragnar’s partner but becomes sovereign in her own right. Her path is earned, not inherited. When she leaves Ragnar after being disrespected, that moment rewires how we see her. She's not just his counterpart — she's her own epic. She becomes Queen of Kattegat in Season 4 — not by bloodline, but by merit, grit, and grace. One powerful moment was when she stepped in to lead the defense of Kattegat — knowing the odds were against them, she rallies her people to defend their homes and live or die free. As a warrior-strategist, her unmatched intellect and decisions saved Kattegat. That battle solidified her role as more than just a shield-maiden — it crowned her with earned sovereignty.</p>

  <p>Her journey can be mapped onto <em>Al-‘Arsh al-ʿAẓīm</em> — a throne earned by the path of physical strength, freedom, responsibility, and sacred power.</p>

  <h3>Freyja and the Composite Archetype</h3>
  <p>In <em>Valhalla Vikings</em>, they launch the full rise of a female hero. I appreciated the effort. The writers’ instincts were right, and the story had enough sacred weight to support Freyja.</p>

  <p>At first, I thought this character was tied to the “Glorious Throne” archetype — <em>Al-‘Arsh al-Majīd</em> — like our mystical messengers Ibrahim and Muhammad. But the more I watched, I realized — she walks through many frequencies. She’s a dreamer, like Joseph, interpreting visions. She carries Moses’ burden as a savior of faith. And there’s a Marian energy to her — carrying truth through divine calling. She doesn't rise by might. She rises by vision — a throne <em>revealed</em>, not seized. A holy task given to one who carries the seed of faith. A “Jesus,” she brings restoration.</p>

  <p>Now I’m losing track of my thoughts — or maybe the plot is losing me. The thrones don’t line up for me in Season 2 of <em>Valhalla Vikings</em>. That morning, this divine pattern echoed louder when I recited the verses of Surah Ghafir. There, for the first and only time, the name <strong>Al-Ḥayy</strong> — <em>The Ever-Living</em> — appears alone, defined clearly as the only God. How did I forget that?</p>

  <p>The beauty of Surah Ghafir is beyond description. I encourage you: read it early in the morning, while thinking of something lost or deeply desired. Watch how it revives your spirit.</p>

  <p><strong>Al-Ḥayy</strong> revives the knowledge already hidden in you — in dreams, in your DNA, in your neural pathways. The revival is a process. That process is under the domain of Allah — <strong>Ar-Raḥmān</strong>, who is <em>seated upon the Throne</em> ("<strong>Ar-Raḥmān ʿalā al-ʿArsh istawā</strong>").</p>

  <p>That’s the same name Maryam used to describe God — <em>Ar-Raḥmān</em>. In Surah Maryam, when she is confronted and questioned about her miraculous pregnancy, she responds not with logic, but with surrender to divine mercy, referring to God as <em>Ar-Raḥmān</em>. That Viking queen in the <em>Valhalla</em> mythical series walks a path to a throne that defies definition — one that can’t be captured by a single essence or all the thrones combined. <strong>Al-Ḥayy</strong> announces in that āyah all the names we might call upon in times of need — to evolve, to restore, to survive. The throne: spacious with knowledge, surrounded only by mercy.</p>

  <p>What started as a binge-watch became a revelation — that myths echo truth, and sacred texts carry the blueprint of all thrones: inner and outer, human and divine.</p>

  <p><strong>That was me, watching <em>Vikings</em>.</strong></p>
