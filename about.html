<p>We are Frequency Dancers — Waveform Sculptors.</p>

<p>
A cosmic butterfly inspires us to be many in one: musician, cosmologist, lighting artist, dancer, photographer...  
Uniting starlight and sub-bass is our nature.
</p>

<p>
We breathe in the future and exhale the present. We only look back to see ourselves in the stories — to admire the versions of us that once were: divine echoes in creation, reminding us to be fully here.
</p>
<p>
Every piece of art is an attempt to describe the Divine — a soundwave infused with intention, echoing the essence of Joy.  
The moving image of joy is the dancer: decoding frequencies, rewiring memory, forging each step into a hypnotic ritual on the dance floor.  
Each pulse is a ripple. Each ripple, a smile. Each smile, a transformation — a return to Joy.
</p>
<p class="section-title"><strong>Experience the Butterfly Effect</strong></p>

<p>Gathered in the mystic realm — from dreams to reality — we claim nothing. We simply stand, 
  performing what has already been choreographed by the spirit of Joy, grateful to be witnesses
Every detail is designed to awaken the infinite — a chain reaction of movement, memory, and meaning.  
This is more than performance.  
It is sonic architecture.  
It is the cosmic butterfly effect.</p>
