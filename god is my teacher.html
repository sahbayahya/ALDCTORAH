    <p>When I started reading the Qur’an again—after years of keeping it closed—I was surprised by how much freedom it held. It’s a book of questions, of requests, of needs, even demands. It’s a dialogue. And God clearly states that answers are given through learning the <em>rules</em> of what you want and need.</p>

    <p>For the longest time, I wondered why God insists—almost in every illustrative Surah—to mention the creation of the heavens and the earth and everything in between. But through experience, I began to see: every time I took an interest in one of God's names, or a phrase from the Qur’an, it led me to knowledge. Knowledge of myself, mostly. And most times, I’d end up forgetting what I was originally looking for, lost in awe at the layers of truth I’d uncovered.</p>

    <p>I was trained in the Western style of education. In Sudan, we followed the top-down British system—starting with theory, and maybe applying it later. Later, I encountered the bottom-up approach—the American way—where students begin with doing, and theory follows. That felt more alive to me.</p>

    <p>But the Qur’an… the Qur’an is a different kind of teacher altogether. “<strong>الرحمن علم القرآن</strong>” — <em>The Most Merciful taught the Qur’an</em>. It invites you to follow your interests. To move through curiosity. And I must admit—my love for learning had dimmed when school stopped being useful to my real life. Where did those equations live beyond the exam papers?</p>

    <p>And yet… my mind expanded. I stopped “learning” in the traditional sense and started recognizing patterns—<strong>living</strong> patterns.</p>

    <p>I left my office as a cosmologist because I wanted to live. I didn’t expect that the equations I’d studied for most of my life would begin to <em>breathe</em> with me. That they’d show up in the rhythm of things, in real time.</p>

    <p>Then I found this beautiful book, <em>The Jazz of Physics</em>, and I realized I wasn’t alone. So many cosmologists before me walked these winding paths—studying the universe and finding it in music, in jam sessions, in 3:00 a.m. wine-sipped conversations in Manhattan bars.</p>

    <p>Who would’ve thought that the book my family revered—the one my mother made sure I always packed in my travel bag—would become the portal to my real education? For years I kept the Qur’an out of love for her, as a souvenir. But the day I finally opened it… that’s when my true learning began.</p>

    <p>Now, five years into this journey—through yoga, dream spells, quantum techniques, and the mystic path of the Qur’an—I’ve made many mistakes, like any student. But what continues to <em>blow my mind</em> is that every single time I fall, forgiveness is already standing in front of me: <strong>غفور رحيم</strong> — <em>Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.</em></p>

    <p>My practice is simple. I wake up early and recite a Surah slowly, breathing with it, focusing on pronunciation, letting the words settle into my body before the world gets loud. Over time, I started waking with phrases floating into my mind—like “<strong>لنهدينهم سبلنا…</strong>” (<em>We will surely guide them to Our paths</em>). I’d look it up—Al-Ankabut—and that Surah would lead me to another, like a breadcrumb trail of meaning.</p>

    <p>On one Tuesday, for example, I started with Surah Ar-Rahman. Then it led me to Al-Ankabut. That led me to Al-Qalam. That day was already patterned—coded for learning. A day of solitude and knowledge unraveling itself. And I probably wouldn’t see anyone.</p>
